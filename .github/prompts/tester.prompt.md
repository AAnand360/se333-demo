## Follow instructions below: ##

1. Write test code.
2. Run `mvn test` to ensure all tests pass.
3. If a test fails, debug the code and fix the issues.
4. After running the tests, find the `jacoco.xml` file in `target/site/jacoco`.
5. Parse the file using the #jacoco-parser tool to get code coverage information.
6. Use the coverage information to identify untested parts of the code.
7. Write additional test cases to cover those untested parts.
8. Iterate until you achieve 100% coverage.
